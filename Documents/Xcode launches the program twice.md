# Problem

When developing OpenGL applications on macOS using GLFW and Xcode, I observed an unusual behavior: building and running the application directly from Xcode would not work as expected: **the program would often spawn multiple windows instead of just one**.

This behavior was puzzling, especially after ensuring that `glfwDestroyWindow(window)` and `glfwTerminate()` was correctly called at the end of the program's execution to clean up GLFW's resources. The issue seemed tied directly to the presence of the debugger.

# Solution

My first attempt to address this was to disable attaching the debugger to the executable, which did resolve the multiple window issue but meant I lost the ability to debug the program effectively.

However, I later discovered that this was not a unique issue to my setup. It appeared to be a known problem with Xcode and GLFW, particularly when using the debugger.

The workaround I found to mitigate this issue while retaining debugging capabilities was surprisingly simple: adding a brief pause at the very beginning of the `main` function, before any calls to `glfwInit()` or other library initializations. 

By **inserting a simple sleep** for one second using , I gave the operating system and the debugger a small window of time to finalize the termination and cleanup of the previous process.

```cpp
#ifdef __APPLE__
    // Sleep for 1 second as waiting debugger to start
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
#endif
```
